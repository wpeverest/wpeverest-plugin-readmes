= Support Policy =

We will happily patch any confirmed bugs with this plugin, however, we will not offer support for:

1. Customizations of this plugin or any plugins it relies upon
2. Conflicts with "premium" themes from ThemeForest and similar marketplaces (due to bad practice and not being readily available to test)
3. CSS Styling (this is customization work)

If you need help with customization you will need to find and hire a developer capable of making the changes.
